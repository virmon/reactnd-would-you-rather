# reactnd-would-you-rather
reactnd-would-you-rather is a question and answer game that begins with a question "Would you rather...". Players may choose a poll created by other players or their created poll as well. In every poll, a player is required to choose from two options in order to complete the game. For every answered question, a result will be shown showing the players' vote and the percentage of how many players voted the same or not. Every question answered and question created equates to 1 point. The total of it will be the players' score that will be shown in the leaderboard section.
